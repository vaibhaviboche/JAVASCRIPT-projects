// Step 1: Create the books array with at least three book objects
const books = [
  {
    title: "The Great Gatsby",
    authorName: "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    releaseYear: 1925
  },
  {
    title: "1984",
    authorName: "George Orwell",
    releaseYear: 1949
  },
  {
    title: "To Kill a Mockingbird",
    authorName: "Harper Lee",
    releaseYear: 1960
  },
  {
    title: "Brave New World",
    authorName: "Aldous Huxley",
    releaseYear: 1932
  }
];

// Step 2: Define the sortByYear callback function
function sortByYear(book1, book2) {
  if (book1.releaseYear < book2.releaseYear) {
    return -1;
  } else if (book1.releaseYear > book2.releaseYear) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}

// Step 3: Filter out books released after 1950
const filteredBooks = books.filter(book => book.releaseYear <= 1950);

// Step 4: Sort the filteredBooks array using sortByYear
filteredBooks.sort(sortByYear);
